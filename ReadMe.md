ABOUT THE PROJECT:

In 2015, the United Nations introduced the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a global framework of 17 interconnected goals aimed at addressing the world’s most pressing challenges. These goals cover critical areas such as poverty, education, climate action, and inequality, with the shared vision of achieving sustainable development by the year 2030. 

Despite the significance of these goals, a major challenge lies in educating the younger generations about the SDGs in a way that fosters deep understanding and active engagement. The complexity of global issues requires more than just surface-level awareness. However, most existing educational resources on the SDGs tend to focus on memorization of the goals, offering little in the way of hands-on learning that encourages students to critically engage with the material.

Our project aims to bring the SDGs into high school classrooms in a way that is engaging, meaningful, and aligned with modern educational practices. By leveraging interactive digital tools and methodologies, such as challenge-based learning and educational games, we seek to make the SDGs not only accessible but also exciting for students. Our web-based application will not only provide students with a platform to explore the SDGs but it’ll also encourage them to think deeply about the interconnections between the goals and real-world problems.


PROJECT OVERVIEW:

The GRADATIM web application hopes to be an innovative educational platform designed to engage high school students in exploring the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through an interactive and hands-on approach. The app will serve as a tool to assist students in understanding how the SDGs are interconnected and in identifying the ways in which different goals can overlap to create complex global challenges.
Rather than just introducing each SDG in isolation, the app facilitates our combined SDGs methodology by guiding students through the process of finding meaningful connections between  goals. Students are encouraged to explore the ripple effects that arise when two SDGs intersect, and to propose actionable solutions that address these multifaceted issues. This methodology highlights the importance of recognizing the SDGs as interconnected elements of a larger, systematic effort to promote sustainability. By focusing on combining two SDGs, this method promotes a deeper understanding of the intricacies involved in addressing global issues, encouraging critical thinking and problem-solving.

The "Build Your Challenge" feature further supports this process by providing students with tools and structured guidance to help them develop their own problem scenarios based on real-world contexts. Step-by-step prompts assist users in analyzing the selected SDGs and framing their challenge, encouraging them to consider relevant data from NASA’s Earth observations. With the support of these interactive data sets, students can ground their solutions in real-world evidence, making their proposals more impactful and scientifically sound.
In addition to facilitating the combined SDGs approach, the web app also offers a range of complementary features, including an interactive global board where users from different regions can share their ideas and solutions, an ODIS section for short-form educational videos (similar to reels or TikToks), and engaging games that further enhance students' understanding of the SDGs in a fun and interactive way. These elements create a dynamic, collaborative learning environment that motivates students to explore, share, and learn from others.


OUR METHODOLOGY: 

By connecting two seemingly unrelated SDGs, students will develop higher-order thinking skills like analysis, evaluation, and synthesis. This is crucial for solving the multifaceted challenges present in today’s world. The Gradatim web app will prepare students not only for academic success but also for the complexities of real-world problem-solving, an essential competency in future careers. Furthermore, this approach encourages resilience and adaptability, as students must navigate the intersections of global challenges, fostering emotional intelligence alongside their cognitive growth.

In addition to challenge-based learning, the platform will incorporate game-based learning elements along with other engaging learning materials, which are proven to increase student engagement and motivation. Adolescents are particularly drawn to interactive experiences, and educational games offer a medium that breaks down complex material into manageable, bite-sized tasks. Games also provide a low-risk environment where students can experiment, fail, and try again—essential components of the learning process. According to research on gamification in education, using game mechanics like points, leaderboards, or badges boosts motivation, making the learning process more dynamic and interactive. Although games are not the primary focus of the app, we intend to integrate purposeful mini-games that reinforce students' understanding of the SDGs while keeping them engaged.
By combining challenge-based learning with gamification, our project is uniquely positioned to meet the needs of high school students, aligning with their cognitive development while fostering a deeper, more connected understanding of the global issues they will face in the future.


BACKGROUND AND PEDAGOGICAL FOUNDATIONS:

Research in education and psychology shows that challenge-based learning and problem-solving promote deeper understanding and long-term retention of complex topics. High school students, at this developmental stage, are particularly suited for tasks that require critical thinking and active engagement. Adolescents are transitioning from concrete to abstract thinking, making them more open to tackling complex, real-world issues that require them to synthesize information across different domains. Presenting high school students with challenging tasks not only engages their developing cognitive abilities but also encourages them to take ownership of their learning.

The  essence of the GRADATIM web aplication is built on these educational principles, looking to integrate the SDGs into the high school curriculum in a way that requires students to critically analyze how different goals intersect. Rather than memorizing the goals in isolation, students must explore how the intersection of two SDGs creates complex, real-world challenges that demand creative solutions. This challenge-based approach mirrors the constructivist learning theory, which emphasizes students constructing their own understanding through inquiry, exploration, and reflection. It is especially effective for high school students, as it taps into their growing ability to reason, hypothesize, and engage with global issues.
